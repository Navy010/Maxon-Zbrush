#  Main features of ZBrush:
⦁	Digital Sculpting: Advanced digital sculpting tools that allow for highly detailed and organic modeling, using techniques like DynaMesh, ZSpheres, and Sculptris Pro.

⦁	PolyPainting: Directly paint on the surface of models without the need for UV mapping, allowing for intricate textures and colors.

⦁	Dynamic Subdivision: Adjust the subdivision levels dynamically to work on different levels of detail without permanently altering the base mesh.

⦁	ZRemesher: Automated retopology tool that creates clean and optimized mesh topology, essential for animation and further modeling work.

⦁	Brush Customization: Extensive options for customizing brushes to suit specific sculpting and texturing needs, with support for importing and creating custom brushes.

⦁	Live Boolean: Non-destructive Boolean operations that allow for complex model combining and subtracting while maintaining workflow flexibility.

⦁	Multi-resolution Mesh Editing: Work on different levels of detail simultaneously, enabling high-resolution detailing while maintaining a lower-resolution base mesh for animation and other uses.
